# Java Training

## Part 1 - Learning Java

_(Skip this part if you have taken AP Comp Sci)_

For learning Java, we currently recommend using [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java), but most sources are likely to work.

If you choose codecademy, skip any of the parts that require payment, you needn't pay money to learn to program online.

## Part 2 - Installing Software

To program FRC robots in Java, a custom build of Visual Studio Code is required.

Follow the instructions on the [wpilib website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) in order to install this software.

Once WPILIB VSCode is installed, you are ready to go, unless you want to configure VSCode further.

#### Configuring VSCode

Some common configuration options include:

-   Custom themes (I personally recommend Atom One Dark)
-   Coloring bracket pairs (), [], {}
    -   Search in VSCode settings for this option and enable it
-   Setting a default terminal
    -   Again, search in settings to change it
    -   Press Ctrl/Cmd + J to toggle it

Lastly, I highly recommend learning VSCode shortcuts, as they can dramatically speed up your workflow (just look it up on google, there are a million articles).
