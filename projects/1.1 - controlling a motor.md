# Running a Motor

In this example, we will be controlling a motor (Talon SRX) at a percent output (-1 to 1). Motors can be controlled in many different ways, but setting a percent output (0 would be off, while 1 would be full speed) can be one of the simplest.

### 1. Installing Libraries

See [this page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html#rd-party-libraries) for a link to many of the latest third party libaries.

Copy the link for the CTRE Phoenix Framework from the page linked above.

Now, in your project, click the W (WPILIB) icon at the top right, and type "Manage Vendor Libraries".

Select that, and then press "Install new library (online)"

Paste the link you copied, and press enter. It may ask you to build the project, and allow it to do so. If there is a problem, either try to debug it, or ask the lead programmer, the programming mentor, or another experienced programmer.

### 2. Cleaning Up the Code

Open `Robot.java` in _src/main/java/frc/robot_.

Press `Cmd+A` or `Ctrl+A` to select the whole file, and then paste in the following code into `Robot.java`:

```java
package frc.robot;

import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_TalonFX;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.CommandScheduler;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
    // Declare variables here

    // Runs once when the robot is first turned on
    @Override
    public void robotInit() {

    }

    @Override
    public void robotPeriodic() {
        CommandScheduler.getInstance().run();
    }

    // Runs once when robot is enabled
    @Override
    public void teleopInit() {

    }

    // Runs every 20 milliseconds
    @Override
    public void teleopPeriodic() {

    }

    // Runs once when robot is disabled
    @Override
    public void disabledInit() {

    }
}
```

### 3. Instantiating the Motor Controller

The first thing we have to do is create a variable for our motor controller. Each motor on a robot has a motor controller that controls the motor based on the instructions we send it. 

We don't interact directly with the motor, but just with a motor controller. Now, let's create our first motor controller!

Type the following code below where it says _"Declare variables here"_:

```java
WPI_TalonFX motorController = new WPI_TalonFX(11);
```

Congratulations! You have now created your first motor controller object!

There are a couple key details to remember about this line.

1. We are calling the variable `motorController` which is **camel-case** (e.g. helloWorld, myFavoriteColor, etc.)
2. We have the number `11` as the first argument to the motor controller. Each motor controller has a port, and this number is that port _(we can configure this, and feel free to ask a programmer how this is done if you are curious)_.

### 4. Setting the Motor Output

In `teleopInit`, type `motorController.set(0.3);`. This will set the motor to run forward at 30% speed as soon as we enabled the robot in teleop mode.

Next, type `motorController.stopMotor();` in `disabledInit`. This will stop the motor whenever we disable the robot.

### 5. Testing Your Code

While we can test on a physical robot, it is a better habit to test your code in a simulation before running it on a robot. 

We will be running our code in a simulation for the remainder of this course.

Here is an demo for this project:

If everything is working, congrats!
