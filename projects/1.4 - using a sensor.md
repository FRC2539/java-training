# Using Sensors

In this section, we will build on the previous section, in which we controlled a motor. 

Rather than using buttons or axes to control the motor, we will use a sensor to detect when the motor should stop.

## Running Motor with Sensor

### Imports

**Remove** the following line from the top of the `Robot.java` file. We won't be needing this anymore.

```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.Joystick;
```

### Cleaning Up the Code

Your `Robot.java` file should currently look like this (feel free to replace your current code with this):

```java
package frc.robot;

import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_TalonFX;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.CommandScheduler;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
    // Declare variables here
    WPI_TalonFX motorController = new WPI_TalonFX(11);


    // Runs once when the robot is first turned on
    @Override
    public void robotInit() {

    }

    @Override
    public void robotPeriodic() {
        CommandScheduler.getInstance().run();
    }

    // Runs once when robot is enabled
    @Override
    public void teleopInit() {
		
    }

    // Runs every 20 milliseconds
    @Override
    public void teleopPeriodic() {
		
    }

    // Runs once when robot is disabled
    @Override
    public void disabledInit() {
        motorController.stopMotor();
    }
}
```

### Variables

Next, we'll add our sensor into the code. Add the following line below our motor controller.

```java
AnalogInput sensor = new AnalogInput(0);
```

This sensor will provide us with analog data (_meaning that it provides a range of values, rather than a simple on or off_).

### Sensor -> Motor

Previously, we used buttons and axes to turn the motor on and off. 

In this example, we want our motor to turn on and off using a connected sensor. However, rather than turning the motor on when we detect something, we will turn the motor off.

This is useful with an intake type mechansim, where we want to hold a game piece in a certain position within the robot.

Add the following logic to `teleopPeriodic` to correctly utilize the sensor:

```java
if (sensor.getValue() < 50)
    motorController.stopMotor();
else
    motorController.set(0.3);
```

Notice that the order of `stopMotor` and `set` are reversed here. 

`sensor.getValue() < 50` checks if we have detected something with our sensor. 

If so, we stop the motor. If nothing is detected, however, we run the motor.

# Testing in Simulation

Unfortunately, this is not convenient to simulate. 

If you'd like to learn more about sensors, there is a great resource on the WPILib docs:

I'd highly recommend it!
