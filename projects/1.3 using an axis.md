# Controller Axes

Rather than controlling our motor on a button press like in the last project, we will control it using a joystick axis (which returns decimal values from -1 to 1).

## Running with a Joystick

### Imports

**Remove** the following lines to the top of the `Robot.java` file. We won't be needing these two anymore.

```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.JoystickButton;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.Trigger;
```

### Variables

Next, we'll remove the Joystick button we created in the previous project. Delete this line:

```java
Trigger button1 = new JoystickButton(joystick, 1);
```

### Cleaning up `teleopPeriodic`

Delete all of the contents of `teleopPeriodic` that we added in the last project.

### Axis -> Motor

In our previous project, the motor started as soon as we pressed the button. Now, we want to use an axis to control the motor. 

On an XBOX controller, this would mean pushing one of the joysticks left or right, and the further you push it, the faster the motor will go.

The logic for this project is much simpler than in the last one. Assuming you have deleted the old logic from `teleopPeriodic`, it should now look like this:

```java
public void teleopPeriodic() {

}
```

Add the following line to the inside of `teleopPeriodic` to complete the program:

```java
motorController.set(joystick.getRawAxis(0));
```

**Remember that `teleopPeriodic` runs every 20 milliseconds.**

Think of this code like a simple flow chart. 

First we find the position of the joystick (-1 would be all the way to the left, while 1 would be all the way to the right).

Next, we tell the motor controller to run the motor at a percent output, from (-1 to 1). Rather than giving it a set number, like 0.3, **we use the joystick position as the speed of the motor**!

### Testing in Simulation

Now, we are ready to test out our code! The following GIF should explain how to test our axis control in simulation.

**Note: Axis 0 is `a` for left and `d` for right.**
