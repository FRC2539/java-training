# Creating a Project

Before we begin, the goal of these projects is to be additive. That means that each one should build on previous projects.

For that reason, a single personal robot project should suffice for progressing through this training.

For creating a project, I strongly recommend reading over [this article](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-4/creating-benchtop-test-program-cpp-java.html) on the wpilib docs.

When creating the project:

1. Choose template, not example
2. Select Java as the language
3. Choose Timed Robot
4. Choose a folder on your computer to make the project in
5. Name the project anything (e.g. yourname-robot)
6. Check "create a new folder"
7. Our team number is 2539
8. Desktop support is up to you, but I recommend it for running simulation

Now you are done creating your first project!

Move on to the next "project"
