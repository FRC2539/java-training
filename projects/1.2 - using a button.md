# Controller Buttons

In this short project, we will control the motor we created in the last project using a button.

## Why Use Buttons?

Controllers (like XBOX and PS4) are our main way of controlling our robot on the field.

Controllers have buttons and axes, which can be used when driving the robot. A button is either on or off (aka `true`/`false`) while an axis returns a value from -1 to 1.

## Running on a Button Press

### Imports

Add the following lines to the top of the `Robot.java` file, below the other imports. We will need all of these features for this project.

```java
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.Joystick;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.JoystickButton;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.Trigger;
```

### Variables

Underneath where we created our motor controller, add these two lines:

```java
Joystick joystick = new Joystick(0);
Trigger button1 = new JoystickButton(joystick, 1);
```

Each Joystick (controller) we have connected will have in `id`, with the first being `0`.

Joystick buttons are numbered from 1 on. If this were a real joystick, we would give it a more meaningful name, like `buttonX` on an XBOX controller. 

### Button -> Motor

In our previous project, the motor started as soon as we enabled teleop mode. Here, we want the motor to run only if the button is being pressed.

Begin by **removing** this line from `teleopInit`:

```java
motorController.set(0.3);
```

Next, we will add the appropriate logic to `teleopPeriodic`:

```java
if (button1.getAsBoolean()) {
    motorController.set(0.3);
} else {
    motorController.stopMotor();
}
```

**`teleopPeriodic` runs every 20 milliseconds, allowing our logic to repeat.**

In the if statement, we check whether or not our button is currently pressed. `button1.getAsBoolean()` returns `true` if our button is currently pressed, or `false`, if it is not pressed.

If it is, we run our motor like we did before, at 30% speed. If not, we stop running the motor. 

_Without the second part where we stop the motor, it would not stop, even if we released the button._

### Testing in Simulation

Now, we are ready to test out our code! The following GIF should explain how to test our button control in simulation.

**Note: button 1 in the simulation is the key z, once you drag Keyboard 0 onto Joystick 0.**
